Nurpawiki
---------

Nurpawiki is a simple wiki written for Ocsigen by Janne Hellsten
(jjhellst@gmail.com).  It's primary purpose is to server as a code
example for Ocsigen module developers.

Compiling & running
-------------------

1. Make sure you have compiled Ocsigen two directories below.
2. Compile nurpawiki.cma by running "make" in examples/nurpawiki.
3. Start Ocsigen with Nurpawiki by running

   ./server/ocsigen -c examples/nurpawiki/files/nurpawiki.conf

4. Point your browser to localhost:9999/view?p=WikiStart

Implementation

Wiki page storage

Each wiki page is a file in the wiki storage directory
(examples/nurpawiki/wikidata/ is the default).  A wiki page "Foo"
corresponds to a file called "Foo.wiki" in the "wikidata" directory.

Character encoding

Wiki pages are stored as UTF-8 text files.  If the site is properly
configured, the wiki properly allows the use of UTF-8 content in wiki
pages.  Since wiki page names map directly to filenames on disk, page
names containing non 7-bit ASCII might not work well.
