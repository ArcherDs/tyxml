(* I think the right way is to register the login box for each page,
   with a fix url. (There is a register for each kind of page).
   If we want to make the url a box parameter saved in the db, it is not
   easy, because we need to make a table of url in which we register
   all the url we want to be able to save. For ex:
let fold_login_box = 
  RegisterHPBoxes.register ~name:"login_box" 
    ~constructor:(fun ~box_param:urltag h -> login_box h (unfold_url urltag))

   But anyway it is not easy to propose to the user (in the web interface to
   create pages) a list of url to put as parameters of boxes.
