    can add modules (like Apache modules) for generating pages,
    filters of requests, extensions of config files. For now there are
    two modules, one for static pages, and one for dynamic pages. The
    only changes for users is that they need to dynlink staticmod.cmo
    and ocsigenmod.cma from the configuration file. The syntax of
    config file for modules and staticdir also changed.

    sub-site.

    to send, and use cooperative input/output functions.
  * Typing errors of parameters are now catchable.
  * {{{static_dir}}} is now a function

    sp as parameter to {{{register_for_session}}}, {{{static_dir}}},

  * EXPERIMENTAL: The {{{Ocsigen}}} module now contains a functor
    {{{Make}}} to allows the use of several ways of generating

    also an untyped xhtml generation module called {{{Ocsigen.Text}}}.
