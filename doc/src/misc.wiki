==Native code version

Ocsigen can be used either in bytecode or in native code (requires OCaml >= 3.11).
To use the native code version, you may need to create a {{{.cmxs}}} file for each plugin
you want to load at startup, if they are not included in your distribution. For example:

{{{
sudo ocamlopt -shared -o /usr/lib/ocaml/3.11.0/sqlite3/sqlite3.cmxs -I /usr/lib/ocaml/3.11.0/sqlite3 /usr/lib/ocaml/3.11.0/sqlite3/sqlite3.cmxa
}}}

The same configuration file can be used for both versions ({{{.cmo}}} and {{{.cma}}}
extensions are converted to {{{.cmxs}}}).

==Improving performance

If you are using persistent data using Sqlite or or Dbm, for example if you are using Ocsipersist or Eliom persistent data, it is possible to improve performance by using a dedicated partition for the database (typically in directory {{{/var/lib/ocsigen}}}). Do not use NFS for that directory.

This is due to the fact that these databases are calling the fsync system call at each request, which is very slow on journalized file systems.

It is also not recommended (for performance) to use NFS for static pages (including user personal pages).
