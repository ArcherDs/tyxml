==@@id="usage"@@ Using TyXML ==

=== Standalone Use ===

To use TyXML in standalone manner, simply link the ##tyxml## ocamlfind package
and use the <<a_api|module Html5>> and <<a_api|module Svg>> modules.

=== Use with another library ===

TyXML combinators can be used in conjunction to another library, please consult the relevent document. For example, for
<<a_manual project="eliom" chapter="clientserver-html"|Eliom>>
and
<<a_api project="js_of_ocaml" text="Js_of_ocaml"|module Tyxml_js>>.

==@@id="creation"@@ Creating documents with TyXML ==

This section assumes you have at your disposal an {{{Html5}}} or {{{Svg}}} module, as instructed in <<a_manual section="usage"|the previous section>>.

The documentation for TyXML combinators is provided in <<a_api|modtype Html5_sigs.T>> and <<a_api|module Svg_sigs.T>> and is common to all instances of {{{Html5}}} and {{{Svg}}}.
