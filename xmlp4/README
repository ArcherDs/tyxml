xmlp4 is a pre-processor and pretty-printer for xml.
Written by Vincent Balat and Julien Mineraud

It creates a syntax extension for caml allowing to write xml inside a caml program
using xml syntax, and a pretty printer.

You define your DTD (for ex xhtml.ml)
Then you apply the functor Xmlparser.make (for ex xhtmlsyntax.ml)
And you write your pretty-printer (for ex xhtmlpp.ml)
