module Engine :
(** The [Engine] is responsible for making asynchronous calls to the server,
  * associate results with registered channels and triggering associated events.
  * The interface is trimmed down to prevent low-level tampering and because of
  * some implementation choices. When the engine is running a comet connection
  * is opened to the server. *)
sig

  val start : unit -> unit
  (** [start ()] makes the engine start. If it was already running, nothing
      happens. *)

  val stop : unit -> unit
  (** [stop ()] makes the engine stop. If it wasn't running, nothing happens. *)

  val running : bool React.S.t
  (** [running] is a signal which value always reflect the state the engine is
      in. *)

  val restart : unit -> unit
  (** [restart ()] makes the engine restart. If it was started, the current XHR
      is canceled and a new one is created. *)

module Channels :
(** [Channels] is a module for basic channel manipulation. On basic channels,
    messages may be lost. *)
sig

  val register : 'a Eliom_common_comet.chan_id -> ('a -> unit Lwt.t) -> unit
  (** [register c f] registers the channel [c] associated to [f] on the engine.
      If the engine wasn't running it is automatically started. Whenever a
      message [m] from the server reaches the client over the channel [c], the
      function [f] is called with [m] as argument. *)

  val unregister : 'a Eliom_common_comet.chan_id -> unit
  (** [unregister c] cancel registration on [c]. The function associated to [c]
      won't be called anymore. *)

end

module Dlisted_channels :
(** [Dlisted_channels] is a module for buffered channels manipulation. Such a
    channel tends not to lose as many messages. All the functions have the same
    semantic, the only difference is on the server side (where some values are
    stored and retransmitted when needed). *)
